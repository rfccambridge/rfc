    /// 
    /// This is how it works [with likely additions like this]:
    /// 
    /// You give it the program to run, as well as a directory that contains a set of
    /// configuration files.  Each configuration file will have a set of tags that say
    /// which should be changed around, and how.  For instance, if the tag is "#ml#",
    /// then the phrase "#ml#1.5#ml#" means that the value is 1.5, and should be changed
    /// by the algorithm.  (The configuration files can be specified.)  The scorer only
    /// looks at config files in the directory its given [but can be specified to search
    /// multiple directories / recurse].
    /// 
    /// Currently, there is no support for having the tag itself appear in the file [but
    /// if useful there eventually will be a way, such as two tags that have nothing inbetween].
    /// 
    /// Currently, all values must be unconstrained doubleing point numbers [eventually there
    /// may be extra information that you can include between the tags, or inside a tag,
    /// specifying what type it it, or what constraints].
    /// 
    /// The scorer will first copy all the files to a backup directory [likely "ml_backup"].
    /// The scorer will then change some or all of the right values, and remove the tags.
    /// Then the external program will be run.  To return a value, this program should
    /// write the result to a specified value (such as "ml.results" -- the first argument to the program),
    /// where the file is just the score in text form, and a newline afterwards.
    /// 
    /// Then the scorer will add back the tags, and possibly change values again.
    /// 
    /// The external program must the files exactly as they are when the program is called;
    /// there is no guarantee that the files will remain constant.  The configuration files
    /// must not be modified externally however.
    /// [Eventually, it will be nice to have multiple scorers running in parallel, on the
    /// same set of configuration files.  This may be very difficult to acheive though,
    /// and it might be better to have them running on separate configuration files.]
