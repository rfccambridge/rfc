/*
 * This file stores all the code for determining the intersection of two lines/circles.  Since there's
 * the arbitrary decision of how to label the intersections, it's good that it's handled in one place
 * rather than both in the designer and the interpreter.
 * 
 * There are also these things that I've called "ImplicitAssumptions."  For instance, what do you do if
 * a point defined by the intersection of two circles doesn't exist, because the two circles don't intersect?
 * And what if that point is used in other things...you get the idea.  If that happens, then an implicit
 * assumption has been failed, which counts as a condition failing.  These may also be included in actions;
 * for instance, maybe you have an action which is to shoot the ball.  What if that robot isn't anywhere
 * near the ball?  So implicit assumptions are basically conditions that the designer/interpreter will handle
 * for you.  Eventually, maybe there'll be a list of them so people will know what they do and don't have to
 * worry about in actions (for instance, do people have to worry about having a clear shot before shooting?).
